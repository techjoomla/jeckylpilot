| **Label** | **Usage**
| ---: | ---
| **channel** | Use channel to tag the _route_ that your link reaches users. For example, tag links with ‘Facebook’ or ‘LinkedIn’ to help track clicks and installs through those paths separately
| **feature** | This is the feature of your app that the link might be associated with. For example, if you had built a referral program, you would label links with the feature ‘referral’
| **campaign** | Use this field to organize the links by actual campaign. For example, if you launched a new feature or product and want to run a campaign around that
| **stage** | Use this to categorize the progress or category of a user when the link was generated. For example, if you had an invite system accessible on level 1, level 3 and 5, you could differentiate links generated at each level with this parameter
| **tags** | This is a free form entry with unlimited values. Use it to organize your link data with labels that don't fit within the bounds of the above
