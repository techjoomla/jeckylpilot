Every Branch link that you create is completely customizable from a functionality perspective. Here are the key variables for customization.

{% protip title="Link Configuration vs. Link Creation" %}
This page describes how to use the link data dictionary to define key/value pairs for deep linking, and the various link analytics and control parameters Branch offers. You can read about how to actually create Branch links in the [Creating Links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links) guide.
{% endprotip %}

## The data structure of Branch links

Conceptually, the data inside a Branch link follows this model:

{% highlight js %}
{
    tags: [ 'tag1', 'tag2' ],
    channel: 'facebook',
    feature: 'dashboard',
    stage: 'new user',
    alias: 'myalias',
    data: {
        mydata: 'something',
        foo: 'bar',
        '$desktop_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com',
        '$ios_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/ios',
        '$android_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/android',
        '$og_app_id': '12345',
        '$og_title': 'My App',
        '$og_description': 'My app\'s description.',
        '$og_image_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/image.png'
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% protip title="Points to understand" %}

- Analytics labels and certain parameters related to the link itself are specified at the top level. These include `channel`, `feature`, `campaign`, `stage`, `tags`, `alias`, `duration`, and `type`, and are documented in the [Link creation customizations]({{base.url}}/getting-started/configuring-links/guide/#link-creation-customizations) section of this page.
- All other parameters (essentially everything prefixed with `$`) go inside the `data` dictionary.
- Any custom data you specify also goes inside the `data` dictionary.

While the mobile SDKs manage this structure automatically, the [Web SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links/other-ways/#web-sdk) and [HTTP API]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links/other-ways/#http-api) do not. It is important to keep this in mind when working with these.

{% endprotip %}

## Link data dictionary

Every Branch link includes a dictionary of `key : value` pairs that is specified by you at the time the link is created. Branch's SDKs make this data available within your app whenever the app is opened via a Branch link click. Read more about how to populate Branch links with data in the [Creating Links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links) guide.

## Link creation customizations

### Analytics labels

Use analytics labels to help _organize your data_. Track updates, run A/B tests and measure the effectiveness of different channels using these labels.

{% ingredient analytics-labels %}{% endingredient %}

### Other parameters

| Key | Usage | Default
| --- | --- | ---
| alias | Specify a link alias in place of the standard encoded short URL (e.g., `[branchsubdomain]/youralias` or `yourdomain.co/youralias`). Link aliases are unique, immutable objects that cannot be deleted. **Aliases on the legacy `bnc.lt` domain are incompatible with [Universal Links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/universal-app-links) and [Spotlight]({{base.url}}/features/spotlight-indexing)**
| duration | *(Deprecated. Use `$match_duration`)* Lets you control the snapshotting match timeout (the time that a click will wait for an app open to match) also known as attribution window. Specified in seconds | `7200`
| type | *(Advanced)* Set to `1` to limit deep linking behavior of the generated link to a single use. Set type to `2` to make the link show up under [Marketing page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/marketing) in the dashboard | `0`

{% ingredient branchsubdomain %}{% endingredient %}

## Link control parameters

These parameters are used to customize the functionality of each individual Branch link, either by specifying a property or overriding a global default.

### Redirect customization

The redirect destinations are completely customizable for every link that you create.

#### Fallback URL customization

| Key | Usage | Default
| --- | --- | ---
| $fallback_url | Change the redirect endpoint for _all_ platforms - so you don't have to enable it by platform. Note that Branch will forward all robots to this URL, overriding any OG tags entered in the link. | System-wide Default URL (set in [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link))
| **$desktop_url** | Change the redirect endpoint on desktops | Text-Me-The-App page (set in [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link))
| $ios_url | Change the redirect endpoint for iOS | App Store page for your app (set in [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link))
| $ios_has_app_url | Change the redirect endpoint for iOS _only for users that Branch knows to have the app installed_ | App Store page for your app (set in [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link))
| $android_url | Change the redirect endpoint for Android | Play Store page for your app (set in [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link))
| **$windows_phone_url** | Change the redirect endpoint for Windows OS | Windows Phone default URL (set in [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link))
| $blackberry_url | Change the redirect endpoint for Blackberry OS | BlackBerry default URL (set in [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link))
| $fire_url | Change the redirect endpoint for Amazon Fire OS | Fire default URL (set in [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link))
| $ios_wechat_url | Change the redirect endpoint for WeChat on iOS devices | `$ios_url` value
| $android_wechat_url | Change the redirect endpoint for WeChat on Android devices | `$android_url` value

#### Country-specific redirects

You can redirect your users differently depending on their location when clicking the link.

| Key | Usage
| --- | ---
| $fallback_url_{xx} | xx is a lower-case Alpha-2 country code conforming to the [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search) standard format. (e.g. `$fallback_url_de` for Germany)

You may add **more** than one country-specific redirect to your link data. Note, that you need to supply a `$fallback_url` to act as the global redirect in addition to the country-specifc ones.

{% caution %}
OS-specifc redirects in your link data (e.g. `$ios_url`) will take precedence over country-specific ones.
{% endcaution %}

#### After click redirect

This lets you customize where Branch will redirect a user's web view after opening up the app or app store. The alternative is that in some configs, we leave a white screen.

{% caution %}
This parameter is currently supported only on iOS.
{% endcaution %}

| Key | Usage
| --- | ---
| $after_click_url | URL redirect to after the main click redirect has completed

#### Web-only links

Web-only links are Branch links that redirect the user to the web *even if the app is installed*. When creating the link, add `$web_only: true` to the deep link data.

Web-only links are distinguished by the presence of an `/e/` (short for "exclusion") between the Branch link domain portion of the link and the link's alpha-encoded unique identifier or alias. Such links are not added to the apple-app-site-association file generated for custom and app.link domains. Note that bnc.lt links will not have `/e/` in the URL, but will instead revert to their non-Universal form, `/m/`.

When you create an aliased web-only link, the alias will apply to both forms of the link. The links `myapp.app.link/myalias` and `myapp.app.link/e/myalias`, then, are the same link, though the web-only form will not open the app on a mobile device even if the app is installed.

{% caution %}
This parameter does not work with [Android App Links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/universal-app-links/).
{% endcaution %}

| Key | Value | Default
| --- | --- | ---
| $web_only | true/false | false (not specified)

{% protip title="Do you use Branch links in email?" %}
Note: when Branch links are wrapped in email service provider click-tracking URLs the web-only parameter may not function as intended, as the email service provider controls how click-tracking links are created.
{% endprotip %}


### Link behavior customization

#### Control parameters

Use these keys to control how URI scheme deep linking functions when opening your app from a link.

{% caution title="Incomplete support on iOS" %}
[Universal Links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/universal-app-links) and [Spotlight]({{base.url}}/features/spotlight-indexing) do not support deep linking via URI paths. If you use `$deeplink_path` or `$ios_deeplink_path`, you will need to implement some custom logic. [Click here for more information]({{base.url}}/getting-started/universal-app-links/advanced/ios/#how-to-handle-uri-paths-with-universal-links).
{% endcaution %}

| Key | Usage | Default
| --- | --- | ---
| $deeplink_path | Set the deep link path for _all_ platforms - so you don't have to enable it by platform. When the Branch SDK receives a link with this parameter set, it will automatically load the custom URI path contained within | `open?link_click_id=1234`
| $android_deeplink_path | Set the deep link path for Android apps. When the Branch SDK receives a link with this parameter set, it will automatically load the custom URI path contained within | *null*
| $ios_deeplink_path | Set the deep link path for iOS apps. When the Branch SDK receives a link with this parameter set, it will automatically load the custom URI path contained within | *null*
| **$match_duration** | Lets you control the snapshotting match timeout (the time that a click will wait for an app open to match) also known as attribution window. Specified in seconds | `7200` (2 hours)
| $always_deeplink | Set to `false` to make links always fall back to your mobile site. Does not apply to Universal Links or Android App Links. We recommend using `$web_only: false` in place of `$always_deeplink: false`. | `true`
| $ios_redirect_timeout | Control the timeout that the client-side JS waits after trying to open up the app before redirecting to the App Store. Specified in milliseconds | `750`
| $android_redirect_timeout | Control the timeout that the clientside JS waits after trying to open up the app before redirecting to the Play Store. Specified in milliseconds | `750`
| $one_time_use | Set to 'true' to limit deep linking behavior of the generated link to a single use. Can also be set using `type` | `false`
| $custom_sms_text | Text for SMS link sent for desktop clicks to this link. Must contain `{% raw %}{{ link }}{% endraw %}` | Value of **Text me the app page** in [Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/settings)
| $marketing_title | Sets the Marketing Title for the deep link in the [Marketing page](https://dashboard.branch.io/quick-links) of the dashboard | *null*

#### Triggering links from within an iFrame

Note that on iOS 9 and 10, Apple has tough restrictions around redirecting from within an iFrame. If you need to trigger a Branch link from an iFrame, we recommend that you use the following:

{% highlight js %}
window.open(<Branch link here>);
{% endhighlight %}

### Deepviews

Control [Deepviews]({{base.url}}/features/deepviews) on a link-by-link basis.

| Key | Value | Default
| --- | --- | ---
| $ios_deepview | The name of the deepview template to use for iOS | `default_template`
| $android_deepview | The name of the deepview template to use for Android | `default_template`
| $desktop_deepview | The name of the deepview template to use for the desktop | `default_template`

## Display customization

{% protip title="Use the BranchUniversalObject if possible!" %}
Most of these parameters can also be specified using the [BranchUniversalObject]({{base.url}}/getting-started/branch-universal-object). This is the preferred method, if available on your platform.
{% endprotip %}

### Content indexing controls

Currently, parameters determine how your content is listed on all public search portals via Branch's app content sitemap. We compile all public links into a sitemap once you've enabled `Google App Indexing` on the Branch dashboard.

| Key | Usage | Default
| --- | --- | ---
| $publicly_indexable | If this content should be public and discovered by other apps. `1` indicates public, and `0` indicates private | `1`
| $keywords | Keywords for which this content should be discovered by. Just assign an array of strings with the keywords you'd like to use
| $canonical_identifier | This is the unique identifier for content that will help Branch dedupe across many instances of the same thing. Suitable options: a website with pathing, or a database with identifiers for entities
| $exp_date | The date when the content will not longer be available or valid
| $content_type | This is a label for the type of content present. Apple recommends that you use uniform type identifier as [described here](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/MobileCoreServices/Reference/UTTypeRef/index.html)

### Open Graph tags

If you do not specify a primary OG tag when creating a link, Branch will perform a one-time scrape of your **$desktop_url** (if set) and attempt to retrieve it.

| Key | Usage | Scraped?
| --- | --- | ---
| $og_title | Set the title of the link as it will be seen in social media displays | yes
| $og_description | Set the description of the link as it will be seen in social media displays | yes
| $og_image_url | Set the image of the link as it will be seen in social media displays | yes
| $og_image_width | Set the image's width in pixels for social media displays | yes
| $og_image_height | Set the image's height in pixels for social media displays | yes
| $og_video | Set a video as it will be seen in social media displays
| $og_url | Set the base URL of the link as it will be seen in social media displays
| $og_type | Set the type of custom card format link as it will be seen in social media displays
| $og_redirect | *(Advanced, not recommended)* Set a custom URL that we redirect the social media robots to in order to retrieve all the appropriate tags
| $og_app_id | *(Rarely used)* Set the OG App ID tag

### Twitter specific

| Key | Usage
| --- | ---
| $twitter_card | Set the Twitter card type of the link
| $twitter_title | Set the title of the Twitter card
| $twitter_description | Set the description of the Twitter card
| $twitter_image_url | Set the image URL for the Twitter card
| $twitter_site | Set the site for Twitter
| $twitter_app_country | Set the app country for the app card
| $twitter_player | Set the video player's URL. Defaults to the value of `$og_video`.
| $twitter_player_width | Set the player's width in pixels
| $twitter_player_height | Set the player's height in pixels

### Custom Tags

You may specify custom tags by adding the following parameter to your link data.

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| $custom_meta_tags | Valid stringified JSON dictionary of the tags' keys and values

- Valid dictionary example: `"{\"twitter:player:stream\": \"https://branch.io\"}"`. This will result in the following meta tag
    `<meta property="twitter:player:stream" content="https://branch.io" />`
- If you create the link via the Dashboard, don't worry about stringifying the dictionary. It will be done automatically.
- `apple_touch_icon` is a special key in the dictionary. If you set it, we will add a `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="<url>" />` tag to the scraped HTML page.
This will allow you to show a custom icon for previews in iMessage, Safari Bookmarks, Slack, etc.

## Appending query parameters to links

### Branch parameters

In addition to specifying parameters when creating a link, you can also append any of them on a case-by-case to the URL of a generated link.

To pass a key/value pair of `$deeplink_path : article/jan/123` on a specific instance of a link:

{% highlight sh %}
https://[branchsubdomain]/l/3HZMytU-BW?$deeplink_path=article%2Fjan%2F123
{% endhighlight %}

The following parameters can **only** be specified by appending to a link:

| Key | Usage | Default
| --- | --- | ---
| has_app | Set to 'true' or 'false' in order to tell us whether you want us to try to open up the app for this particular link or not. Functionally identical to `$always_deeplink` | `true`
| debug | Set to 'true' to route to a link debug page that shows the labels and configuration of a link | Value of **Always try to open app** in [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link)

### Custom parameters

If you append your own custom query parameters to a link, this data will also be captured and passed through when you initiate a Branch session.

To pass a key/value pair of `myparameter : testvalue` on a specific instance of a link:

{% highlight sh %}
https://[branchsubdomain]/l/3HZMytU-BW?myparameter=testvalue
{% endhighlight %}
