Now that your app is configured, it's time to dive into your data with the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io){:target="_blank"}! The dashboard is a great tool for measuring growth and engagement, and offers many powerful configuration options.

## Using link labels to segment data

As you most likely saw in the [Creating Links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links) guide, there are many options for creating links. If your organization is creating links in many different ways, it’s important to label them appropriately.

When you [set analytics labels for your links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/configuring-links/#analytics-labels), you can filter analytics data in the dashboard based on any of these options:

{% ingredient analytics-labels %}{% endingredient %}

Below is the filtering bar on the [Source Analytics page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/analytics/source){:target="_blank"}. You can find similar controls on a number of dashboard pages:

## See link and click data in real time

Tabs for links, clicks, events, content, and more on the [Live View page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/liveview){:target="_blank"} allow you to see generated data in real time.

## Controlling default link redirection behavior

By default, Branch will attempt to launch your app every single time a link is opened, before redirecting to the App Store or Play Store. On iOS 9, this can cause an ugly error message if the app is not yet installed. To reverse this default behavior, you can uncheck the **Always try to open app** box on the [Link Settings page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link){:target="_blank"}:

## UTM parameters and the Branch dashboard

To make it easier for you to get rich attribution data in your dashboard, Branch will map UTM parameters to the Branch Analytics Tags.

Currently, this is available only for parameters appended to **[dynamic Branch links]({{base.url}}/getting-started/creating-links/other-ways#appending-query-parameters)**. At this time, it is not enabled for parameters on $fallback_url or for other links, like Quick Links - coming soon!

The mapping is as follows:

| UTM Parameter Tag |	Branch Analytics Tag |
| --- | --- |
| utm_source | Channel |
| utm_medium | Feature |
| utm_campaign | Campaign |
| utm_content | Tags |
| utm_term | Keywords (not visible in Dashboard charts) |

By default, UTM parameters will only fill in Branch Analytics Tags that are not already specified. You can change this behavior by going to the **Advanced Settings** section of the [Link Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings/link) page on the Branch dashboard and checking the **Use UTM tags for analytics (for dynamically-created links)** box.
