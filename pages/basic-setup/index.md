There are a million and one ways to use Branch in your app! In this section, we get you up to speed on the basics of the Branch platform.

#### If this is your first visit...
- The **[SDK Integration Guide](/getting-started/sdk-integration-guide/guide/ios/)** is a good place to begin. This covers what you need to get our mobile SDK integrated into your app, which is the foundation for everything else.

#### Next steps to take
- After integrating the SDK, you will want to enable **[Universal and App Links](/getting-started/universal-app-links/overview/)**, especially if your app contains an iOS version. **You must enable Universal Links before Branch can function correctly on iOS 9.2+!**
- The **[Creating Links in Apps](/getting-started/creating-links/overview/)** page describes how to generate Branch links inside your app.
- **[Deep Link Routing](/getting-started/deep-link-routing/overview/)** allows you to control what users see first after opening your app from a Branch link. It's a powerful feature you will want to enable.
- **[Custom Event Tracking](/cross-channel-analytics/user-value-attribution/guide/ios/#custom-event-tracking)** lets you track events beyond clicks, installs, and opens. Custom Events are reported in the dashboard, so you can see how a link click relates to post-install activities like purchases, signups, and anything else you can imagine.
