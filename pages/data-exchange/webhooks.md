{% if page.overview %}

Branch's webhook system allows you to receive install and down funnel event data from us as it occurs, for install attribution or conversion funnels in your own database. You simply need to specify a URL for us to send all this data to.

The webhook system is very powerful and customizable. You can register to only receive notifications for specific events, or you can register a wildcard and receive all events. You can specify to only receive an event for the first time a user completes it, or every time. You can also specify receive events only in the case of referrals.

{% getstarted %}{% endgetstarted %}

{% elsif page.guide %}

## Register webhook on the Branch dashboard

1. Open the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.branch.io/webhook) page.
1. Click **Add a new webhook**

{% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/add.png' 2-thirds center alt='add a new webhook button' %}

## Configure webhook criteria

{% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/edit.png' 2-thirds center alt='add a new webhook' %}

Here are explanations of what each field on this screen controls:

#### Webhook URL

Enter the URL where you would like the events to be sent.

#### Postback method

Events can be sent either via POST or GET

#### Event frequency

You can choose to receive a webhook for every single event occurrence, or only first time that event is triggered for each unique user.

#### Event trigger

You may select between the following default events:

| **Event** | **Description**
| ---: | ---
| `install` | Triggered the first time a user launches your app
| `open` | Triggered whenever the app becomes active
| `referred session` | Triggered *in addition* to install, open or web session start if a user comes from a Branch link
| `web session start` | Triggered when the user views a webpage using the Branch Web SDK
| `click` | Triggered whenever a Branch link is clicked on any platform
| `-- other --` | Enter an event you [created through the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/user-value-attribution#custom-event-tracking), or a wildcard (`*`) to return every single event tracked through Branch.

{% protip %}
The `referred session` and `web session start` options will only appear after at least one event of that type has been recorded.
{% endprotip %}

#### Filter (Advanced)

See the [Advanced page]({{base.url}}/getting-started/webhooks/advanced#filtering-which-webhooks-are-sent) to read about customizing when events are sent.

## Testing

To test whether your webhook is configured correctly, you can use [requestb.in](http://requestb.in/). RequestBin gives you a URL that accepts events and allows you to see exactly what Branch is sending.

1. Go to [requestb.in](http://requestb.in/) and click **+ Create a RequestBin:** {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/requestbin_create.png' 2-thirds center alt='requestbin create' %}
1. Copy the **Bin URL:** {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/requestbin_inspect.png' 2-thirds center alt='requestbin create' %}
1. Paste this into the URL field of your Branch webhook's configuration screen: {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/requestbin_add_webhook.png' 2-thirds center alt='requestbin inspect' %}
1. Now whenever your webhook is triggered, you will see a full report on RequestBin: {% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/requestbin_response.png' 2-thirds center alt='requestbin response' %}

## Sample webhook POST body syntax

There are two types of events that you can listen for, and each has a different format of webhook POST. The two are:

- **Click** webhooks

Clicks are the way users interact with your Branch links. Please note that a click does not always have to take place in a browser. For example, clicking a Universal Link will open up the app directly, and therefore no browser metadata information will be present.

- **Event** webhooks

Events are user events that either Branch generates or you generate via a call to our event tracking API. Examples are shown on the previous page of this guide.

### Sample POST body for -Click- webhooks

{% endhighlight %}

## Filtering which webhooks are sent

Filters allow you to specify when a webhook gets sent to your URL based off criteria matches. You can configure your filters to use any [webhook keyword value](#webhook-keyword-values) by using liquid tags following this convention: {% raw %}`{{ param.name }}`{% endraw %}.

{% protip title="Wildcard filtering" %}
If you want to filter on just a key being present, you can put a `*` in the value box.
{% endprotip %}

{% example title="Filtering installs by referring link campaign" %}
Let's say you're interested in receiving a webhook for every `install` event that is referred from a Branch link where you set the `Campaign` field to `App Install Campaign`. You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when `~campaign` is equal to `App Install Campaign` like so: The key would equal: `session.link_data.~campaign` and the value would equal `App Install Campaign`

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/session-filter.png" 2-thirds center alt="webhook filter configuration" %}

You can see more examples of session parameters to filter from [in the table below](#session-data).

{% endexample %}

{% example title="Filtering clicks by link channel" %}
Let's say you're interested in receiving a webhook sent every `click` event that is referred from a Branch link where you set the `Channel` field to `AppLovin`. You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when `~channel` is equal to `AppLovin` like so: The key would equal: `click.link_data.~channel` and the value would equal `AppLovin`.

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/click-filter.png" 2-thirds center alt="webhook filter configuration" %}

You can see more examples of click parameters to filter from [in the table below](#click-events).

{% endexample %}

{% example title="Filtering custom signup event by location" %}
Let's say you're interested in receiving a webhook every time your `sign_up` event is triggered via the `userCompletedAction` method in the SDKs, but only in a specific market, like Chicago. Your event metadata will look something like the following:

{% highlight js %}
event: {
    name: "sign_up",
    metadata: {
        "city" : "Chicago",
        "username" : "john_smith_1",
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when `city` is equal to Chicago: `event.metadata.city : Chicago` like so:

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/filters.png" 2-thirds center alt="webhook filter configuration" %}
{% endexample %}

## Templating your Postback URL

If you plan on sending click or install data to a third party, you'll likely need to create one of our templated Postback URLs along side the [aforementioned filters](#filtering-which-webhooks-are-sent). These work very similarly to filters and use the same liquid tags structure: {% raw %}`{{ param.name }}`{% endraw %}. Once the webhook is eligible, the correct value will be filled in to the slot.

{% example title="Creating a dynamic conversion postback for an ad agency" %}

Let's say you have created a Branch link in the Marketing tab specifically for SEM campaigns and you're going to give the link to an advertising agency. This ad agency wants to receive install conversion events from Branch they'll append specific query parameters to your Branch link for tracking so that your Branch link might potentially look something like this: **http://branch.app.link/my-sf-campaign?clickId=12345**.

Now, you want to report conversions back to the agency or your backend, and you know the structure of the desired Postback URL. For example, lets say you want to send a Postback to **http://myagency.com/tracking?event=install&clickId=12345&idfa=<full-IDFA-here>**.

With that information, it's very easy to setup the correct, dynamic Postback URL using our templates! In this case, you need 3 fields to be dynamically populated:

- event name
- clickId
- IDFA value

Branch can easily populate those fields dynamically (and potentially add a lot more as described in the next section) using the following template keys:

- {% raw %}`{{ event.name }}`{% endraw %}
- {% raw %}`{{ session.link_click.query.clickId }}`{% endraw %}
- {% raw %}`{{ device.hardware_id }}`{% endraw %}

 You can create your dynamic Postback URL by using those above tags in place of where the value should go. So, in keeping with the example, the dynamic Postback URL to give to Branch would be and should be pasted into the webhook creation URL field:

 {% raw %}`http://myagency.com/tracking?event={{ event.name }}&clickId={{ session.link_click.query.clickId }}&idfa={{ device.hardware_id }}`{% endraw %}

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/templates.png" 2-thirds center alt="webhook template configuration" %}

Additionally, since you don't want to send them _every_ install event, let's add a [filter](#filtering-which-webhooks-are-sent) to only send the installs that are referred by links which have a `clickId` in the query parameter. In this case, we use a wildcard parameter (`*`) for the key `session.link_click.query.clickId`, which tells Branch to only trigger this webhook when an `install` event was referred by a link with a `clickId`.

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/template-filters.png" 2-thirds center alt="webhook template filter" %}

And with that, we're finished creating our postback!

{% image src="/img/pages/getting-started/webhooks/template-finished.png" full center alt="webhook template filter" %}

{% endexample %}

## Keys available for templating/filtering Click webhooks

When a Branch link is opened, triggering a `click` event, you may access:

- Properties of the visitor who opened the link.
- Properties of the link that was opened.

| Key | Description
| --- | ---
| click.query.key | Any key that was appended to the link when opened. To retrieve `value1` from **https://[branchsubdomain]/test?param1=value1**, you would use `click.query.param1`.
| click.browser.branch_id | The Branch ID we have for a user's unique browser
| click.browser.metadata.userAgent | The user agent of the browser
| click.device.hardware_id | For iOS, this is the Advertising ID. For Android, this is the Android ID.
| click.device.metadata.google_advertising_id | Android only. The Google Advertising ID, if known
| click.device.metadata.os | The OS of the device
| click.device.metadata.os_version | The OS version
| click.date | Time of link click.

Note that `click.device` this will only be available or Universal/App Links where there's no browser redirect and similarly, `click.browser` will only be available for non-Universal/App links. Handle this appropriately in your code.

| Key | Description
| --- | ---
| click.link_data.~id | ID of the link (0 for dynamic and 3P links)
| click.link_data.~creation_source | How the link was created, e.g. iOS SDK, API, etc.
| click.link_data.~tags | Tags of the link
| click.link_data.~campaign | Campaign of the link
| click.link_data.~channel | Channel of the link
| click.link_data.~feature | Feature of the link
| click.link_data.~stage | Stage of the link
| click.link_data.$one_time_use | Whether this was a one time use link or not
| click.link_data.$one_time_use_used | Whether this one time use link was used or not
| click.link_data.$identity_id | Branch internal identity of user who generated the link
| click.link_data.$match_duration | Length of time (in milliseconds) that a match could have occurred
| click.link_data.+url | The full URL of the link, e.g. [branchsubdomain]/m/abcde12345
| click.link_data.key | Any key value you specified in the link's data dictionary
| click.referring_identity.id | ID you set for the user who created this link

## Keys available for templating/filtering Event webhooks

When a user triggers an event inside your app, either one [created by you]({{base.url}}/getting-started/user-value-attribution#custom-event-tracking) or one tracked by Branch automatically (`install`, `open`, `referred session`, and `web session start`), you may access:

- Properties of the event.
- Session properties of the user who triggered the event.
- Identity properties of the user who triggered the event.

{% protip title="Identity vs. Session" %}
**Identity properties** are set *once*, the very first time Branch sees a user. Once set for each user, these are never changed. **Session properties** are the data of the *most recent* record Branch has for a user.

For an initial `install` event, identity and session properties will be the same. For `open` events, session properties will be different if the user has subsequently opened another Branch link.
{% endprotip %}

### Event data (Event webhooks)

| Key | Description
| --- | ---
| event.name | The name of the event (e.g., `install` or `my_custom_event`)
| event.metadata.referred | Equals `true` if user installed app after opening a Branch link
| event.metadata.ip | The IP address of the user
| event.metadata.key | Data defined as `key` when creating a custom event
| event.date | Timestamp of when the event occurred

### Device data (Event webhooks)

Device data provides access to the device snapshot. Branch collects this snapshot both when a user is in the browser – via a click on a Branch link – and then after they open the app. This information includes IP Address, OS, OS version, device model and other parameters.

| Key | Description
| --- | ---
| device.metadata.os | The OS of the device
| device.metadata.os_version | The OS version
| device.metadata.ip | The IP address of the device
| device.metadata.model | The model of the device


### Identity data (Event webhooks)

Identity data is unique for each user Branch tracks. These values are permanently tied to that user, meaning if a link with a campaign of 'google' drives an install, then that user will have a permanent `identity.link_data.~campaign` value equal to 'google'.

{% protip %}
Except for `identity.id`, these will not be populated if the user installed your app without opening a Branch link first.
{% endprotip %}

| Key | Description
| --- | ---
| identity.link_data.~id | ID of the link (0 for dynamic and 3P links)
| identity.link_data.~creation_source | How the link was created, e.g. iOS SDK, API, etc.
| identity.link_data.~tags | Tags of the link
| identity.link_data.~campaign | Campaign of the link
| identity.link_data.~channel | Channel of the link
| identity.link_data.~feature | Feature of the link
| identity.link_data.~stage | Stage of the link
| identity.link_data.$one_time_use | Whether this was a one time use link or not
| identity.link_data.$one_time_use_used | Whether this one time use link was used or not
| identity.link_data.$identity_id | Branch internal identity of user who generated the link
| identity.link_data.$match_duration | Length of time (in milliseconds) that a match could have occurred
| identity.link_data.+url | The full URL of the link, e.g. [branchsubdomain]/m/abcde12345
| identity.link_data.key | Any key value you specified in the link's data dictionary

### Session data (Event webhooks)

Session data refers to the **most recent** record Branch has for each user, regardless of whether it reflects an `install` or an `open` event.

{% protip %}
These will not be populated if the session was not initiated by opening a Branch link.
{% endprotip %}

The `session.link_click` keys refer to the `click` event that initiated the session.

| Key | Description
| --- | ---
| session.link_click.query.key | Any key that was appended to the link when opened. To retrieve `value1` from **https://[branchsubdomain]/test?param1=value1**, you would use `session.click.query.param1`.

The `session.link_data` keys refer to the link that initiated the session.

| Key | Description
| --- | ---
| session.link_data.~id | ID of the link (0 for dynamic and 3P links)
| session.link_data.~creation_source | How the link was created, e.g. iOS SDK, API, etc.
| session.link_data.~tags | Tags of the link
| session.link_data.~campaign | Campaign of the link
| session.link_data.~channel | Channel of the link
| session.link_data.~feature | Feature of the link
| session.link_data.~stage | Stage of the link
| session.link_data.$one_time_use | Whether this was a one time use link or not
| session.link_data.$one_time_use_used | Whether this one time use link was used or not
| session.link_data.$identity_id | Branch internal identity of user who generated the link
| session.link_data.$match_duration | Length of time (in milliseconds) that a match could have occurred
| session.link_data.+url | The full URL of the link, e.g. [branchsubdomain]/m/abcde12345
| session.link_data.key | Any key value you specified in the link's data dictionary

## Authenticating Webhook events

If you need to whitelist the webhook server IP addresses for security purposes, they are listed below.

- `52.9.159.121/32`
- `52.9.176.205/32`

Reserved for future use:

- `52.9.188.221/32`
- `52.9.188.236/32`

You can also [create events through the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/user-value-attribution#custom-event-tracking), and specify a secret key inside the event metadata to pass through inside the URL of the webhook itself.

{% elsif page.support %}

## FAQs

##### Why is my app not sending a device ID?

Check to see if you are in [Test Mode]({{base.url}}/getting-started/integration-testing) with your SDK. If we are sending a fake ID to simulate installs, we will not send it inside a webhook.

##### What's the difference between first referring data and session referring data?

Because webhooks are event based, and tie back to a unique user, we send you data from the link that first drove this unique user into your app. Then, if they click another Branch link later, we also send you session referring data from this second link. For an initial install event, these should be the same. For any subsequent events, session referring data may be different.
