{% prerequisite %}
- This guide requires you to have already [integrated the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/sdk-integration-guide) into your app.
- Note that this integration only works on the core Android and iOS SDKs, not the 3rd party platforms like Unity, Xamarin, etc. You must call the Answers SDK even tracking methods directly send the data.
{% endprerequisite %}

## How it works

Integration with Fabric's Answers is totally automatic as long as you've integrated both Branch and Answers. Branch will automatically send the following three events to Answers:

- `Branch Install`: This event is sent when a user installs your app after clicking a Branch link.
- `Branch Open`: This event is sent when a user clicks a Branch link but already has your app installed.
- `Branch Share`: This event is sent when the has shared a link on a channel using the [Branch share sheet]({{base.url}}/getting-started/branch-universal-object/guide/ios/#showsharesheetwithlinkproperties).

With every single event that's recorded, the following custom Branch link analytics labels are sent as Answers event attributes *if present*:

- `channel`
- `campaign`
- `feature`
- `stage`
- `tags`
- `referring_link`
