{% if page.overview %}

The Branch partnership with [Appboy](https://www.appboy.com) provides a push-button way to deliver Branch installs and attributions to your Appboy dashboard. This allows you to analyze your users coming in from Branch deep linked campaigns.

**At this time, our integration only applies to the iOS platform.**

{% ingredient paid-integration %}{% endingredient %}

## How it works

We have built a custom integration to automatically send all Branch install data to Appboy without any extra work on your side (besides integrating both SDKs). Simply click a button, and you'll be good to go!

{% protip title="How do we differentiate Appboy and Branch installs?" %}We rely on a Branch link being clicked, which leads to an install. This sets an internal boolean that an install came from Branch.{% endprotip %}
