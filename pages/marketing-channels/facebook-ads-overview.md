Branch links can be used together with Facebook ads, allowing you to track ad-driven installs on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app.

The Facebook Ad platform has numerous campaign types which support differing combinations of ad formats. We've created this documentation to help break down how to Branch ad links can support each campaign and ad type combination. We'll update this page as needed if the campaign creation flow is updated, or new ad types are supported.

This documentation supports the following Facebook Campaign types:
