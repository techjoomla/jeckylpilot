With Branch, you can put deep links in every type of Google AdWords campaign, improving conversion rates and letting you measure the impact of your campaigns on mobile.  

The Google AdWords interface can be confusing so we've created a guide to help you find the right documentation. The new AdWords interface (released in beta in May 2017) still follows roughly the same campaign creation flow. We'll update this page as needed if the campaign creation flow is updated, or new ad types are supported.

This documentation supports the following Google Campaign types:
