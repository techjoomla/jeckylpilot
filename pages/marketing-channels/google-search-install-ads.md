{% prerequisite %}
- To track installs from Google Ads you should [integrate the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/sdk-integration-guide) into your app.
- If you want to deep link from your ads directly to content, you should [configure deep link routing]({{base.url}}/getting-started/deep-link-routing).
- Ads is a premium product priced on Monthly Active Users. Sign up for the Ads product to enable this functionality.
{% endprerequisite %}

{% if page.android %}
{% caution title="Android SDK v2.10.0" %}

Ensure the application being promoted by the Ad campaign has the SDK version of **v2.10.0** or later. Starting at this version, accurate measurement of the Google Play link referrer is used which is required to support this Adwords campaign type.

## Create a Branch Ad Link

1. Create a Branch Ad link from the [Partner Management page](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management)'s `Create Google Adwords Link` button under the Google Adwords Partner and select `App Install or Engagement`
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/create-link-install-engagement.png' half center alt='Link Creation' %}
1. Under the Define Section, pick a Link Name for later reference
1. Configure the link with the Ad Format set to **App Only**, the Ad Partner set to **Google Adwords**, and the Secondary Ad Format set to **Google Search Install iOS**, while leaving the Campaign field blank
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-search-install-ads/iOS/ad-link-setup.png' 3-quarters center alt='Create Ad Link' %}
1. Under the Configure Options tab, navigate to the Redirects sub section and ensure that the iOS redirect is set to the desired app being promoted by the ad campaign.
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/ad-link-redirect.png' 3-quarters center alt='Create Ad Link' %}
1. Under the Analytics Tags sub section additional tags can be set. It is recommended to not set Channel and Campaign tags as they will be dynamically generated by Google.
{% image src='/img/pages/features/ads-analytics/analytics-tags.png' 3-quarters center alt='Analytics Tags' %}

{% protip title="Dynamic Channel and Campaign Tags" %}

It is recommended to leave the Channel and Campaign Tags empty as Branch will dynamically set those values to their corresponding **Network** and **Campaign Id** values in Adwords. If you fill in these values yourself it may be more difficult to interpret the information between Branch and Adwords.

{% endprotip %}

{% protip title="Optional: Deep Link Data (Advanced)" %}

You can use this configuration section to specify custom link parameters that will be deep linked into the app after install. These could include a coupon code or a page identifier to route the user. Visit the [Deep Link Routing]({{base.url}}/getting-started/deep-link-routing) page to learn more.

{% endprotip %}

{% protip title="Setting Attribution Windows" %}

You can specify the attribution windows for your links either at an overall account or per link level. Use these windows to accurately measure attribution data for your Branch links. Refer to [Changing attribution windows]({{base.url}}/marketing-channels/ad-network-integrations/advanced/#changing-attribution-windows) for instructions.

{% endprotip %}

## Configure an Ad

To set up a Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign on iOS, you will need to first create your campaign and then setup a tracking template on the ad. Adwords campaign creation documentation is available **[here](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6309969?hl=en)**.

#### Create Your Campaign

1. Select `Search Network only` on Adwords
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/adwords-search-network.png' third center alt='Adwords Network' %}
1. For the type of Search campaign select `Mobile app installs`
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-search-install-ads/adwords-search-install.png' 3-quarters center alt='Adwords Setup' %}
1. Continue setting the campaign and ad group parameters

#### Ad Creation

1. Grab your app's iTunes App Store URL and fill it into the **Final URL** field of your ad setup
1. Expand the `Ad URL options`. and place your Branch Ad link from the first section in the **Tracking template** field. Ensure the copied link has the appropriate additional params (~campaign_id, ~ad_set_id, lpurl, etc.) which should be automatically generated on your Branch dashboard.

{% image src="/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-search-install-ads/iOS/full-branch-link.png" 3-quarters center alt='Example Link' %}

{% image src="/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-search-install-ads/iOS/adwords-configuration.png" 3-quarters center alt='Example Adwords Config' %}

{% protip %}

Because the **Final URL** for your app install campaigns must match your app store domain, you cannot put a Branch link in that box. However, capturing installs and deep linking users through content is still possible due to the **Tracking template** configuration.

{% endprotip %}

{% elsif page.android %}

## Create a Branch Ad Link

1. Create a Branch Ad link from the [Partner Management page](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management)'s **Create Google Adwords Link** button under the Google Adwords Partner and select 'App Install or Engagement'
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/create-link-install-engagement.png' half center alt='Link Creation' %}
1. Under the Define Section, pick a Link Name for later reference
1. Configure the link with the Ad Format set to **App Only**, the Ad Partner set to **Google Adwords**, and the Secondary Ad Format set to **Google Search Install Android**, while leaving the Campaign field blank
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-search-install-ads/Android/ad-link-setup.png' 3-quarters center alt='Create Ad Link' %}
1. Under Configure Options tab, navigate to the sub Analytics Tags sub section to set up additional tags. It is recommended to not set Channel and Campaign tags as they will be dynamically generated by Google.
{% image src='/img/pages/features/ads-analytics/analytics-tags.png' 3-quarters center alt='Analytics Tags' %}

{% protip title="Dynamic Channel and Campaign Tags" %}

## Configure an Ad

To set up a Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign on Android, you will need to first create your campaign and then setup a tracking template on the ad. Adwords campaign creation documentation is available **[here](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6309969?hl=en)**.

#### Create Your Campaign

1. Select `Search Network only` on Adwords
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/adwords-search-network.png' third center alt='Adwords Network' %}
1. For the type of Search campaign select `Mobile app installs`
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-search-install-ads/adwords-search-install.png' 3-quarters center alt='Adwords Setup' %}
1. Continue setting the campaign and ad group parameters

#### Ad Creation

1. Copy the final Branch Ad link generated from the previous section. Note: This link should begin with **https://play.google.com...** instead of the normal Branch link domain. Refer to the [Create A Branch Ad Link]({{base.url}}/marketing-channels/google-search-install-ads/guide/android/#create-a-branch-ad-link) section if the link is not in this format to ensure the link creation was setup properly.
{% image src="/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-search-install-ads/Android/full-branch-link.png" half center alt='Example Link' %}
1. Paste this Ad link into the **Final URL** field

{% image src="/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-search-install-ads/Android/adwords-configuration.png" 3-quarters center alt='Example Ad' %}

{% caution title="Using the Final URL"%}

Google Adwords current implementation of the Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign for Android **fails to support Tracking Templates** despite the option to set them up in the Ad creation process.

Therefore, a unique Play Store link is used in this setup which corresponds to a Branch link. All install capturing and deep linking of content is still possible through this setup.

{% endcaution %}

{% caution title="Limited Click Attribution" %}

As of June 2017, due to the current Adwords Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign implementation, Branch's **Android Click attribution** is only measured when a user installs the mobile application.

{% endcaution %}

## FAQ / Debugging

**Q: Why is my advertisement being disapproved on Adwords?**

**A:** For App Install/Engagement Campaigns, sometimes your ad may be disapproved if the Branch link does not re-direct to Google Play or App Store when clicked on a desktop. Please ensure that for the Branch link you're using to track installs, Deepviews are disabled and a desktop redirect is set to either the App / Play store.
