## Handle Branch links in Appboy delegate

{% tabs %}
{% tab objective-c %}

Open your **AppDelegate.m** file and add the following method (if you completed the SDK Integration Guide of Appboy, this is likely already present).

{% highlight objc %}
- (BOOL)handleAppboyURL:(NSURL *)url fromChannel:(ABKChannel)channel withExtras:(NSDictionary *)extras {
    BOOL handledByBranch = [[Branch getInstance] handleDeepLinkWithNewSession:url];
    if (handledByBranch) {
        return YES;
    }
  // Let Appboy handle links otherwise
    return NO; 
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}

Open your **AppDelegate.swift** file and add the following method (if you completed the [SDK Integration Guide]({{base.url}}/getting-started/sdk-integration-guide), this is likely already present).

{% highlight swift %}
func handleAppboyURL(_ url: URL, from channel: ABKChannel, withExtras extras: [AnyHashable : Any]) -> Bool {
    let handleByBranch = Branch.getInstance().handleDeepLinkWithNewSession(url)
    if handleByBranch {
        return false
    }
    // Let Appboy handle links otherwise
    return true
}
