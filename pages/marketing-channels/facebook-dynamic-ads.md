{% elsif page.guide %}

{% prerequisite %}

- To track installs from Facebook Ads you should [integrate the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/sdk-integration-guide) into your app.
- If you want to deep link from your ads directly to content, you should [configure deep link routing]({{base.url}}/getting-started/deep-link-routing).
- Use [Branch Deep Linked Feeds](/features/deep-linked-feeds) to create your Facebook Dynamic Ad compatible deep links.
{% endprerequisite %}

## Connect Branch to Facebook

Facebook requires a custom deep linking integration for deferred deep linking. Fortunately, Branch handles that all for you! Complete Option 1 or Option 2 in [Connect Branch to Facebook](https://dev.branch.io/features/facebook-ads/guide/ios/#connect-branch-to-facebook) in order to set up your app.

## Create a Deep Linked Feed

Branch makes it easy for you to create and manage feeds with Facebook-compatible deep links.

Learn how to [create a Deep Linked Feed](/features/deep-linked-feeds/guide){:target="_blank"}.

## Upload your feed to Facebook

1. Navigate to your [Facebook Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/){:target="_blank"}.
1. In the top left hand corner, click the overflow menu and select **Product Catalogs**.{% image src='/img/pages/features/facebook-dynamic-ads/fb-product-catalogs.png' half center alt='Facebook Product Catalogs' %}
1. From the drop down menu click "Create new catalog...", name it (remember this name, you'll need it later) and select "Products sold online". {% image src='/img/pages/features/facebook-dynamic-ads/create-new-catalog.png' half center alt='Facebook Create New Product Catalog' %}
1. Now that you have a product catalog, you can add a new feed. Click "Add Product Feed." {% image src='/img/pages/features/facebook-dynamic-ads/add-new-feed.png' 3-quarters center alt='Add new feed' %}
1. If you have a [Hosted Deep Linked Feed](/features/deep-linked-feeds/guide/#schedule-refresh){:target="_blank"} (recommended), select the option "Scheduled recurring uploads." Paste your Branch-provided URL into the **Feed URL** text field. {% image src='/img/pages/features/facebook-dynamic-ads/new-feed-settings.png' 3-quarters center alt='Feed URL option' %} {% image src='/img/pages/features/facebook-dynamic-ads/upload-feed-url.png' 3-quarters center alt='Feed URL settings' %} 
1. If you've created a Deep Linked Feed CSV file to upload, select the option "Single upload: Upload a single file feed now." Select the Deep Linked Feed URL or CSV file you would like to upload to Facebook, and click "Upload". {% image src='/img/pages/features/facebook-dynamic-ads/successful-feed-upload.png' 3-quarters center alt='Feed uploaded' %}
1. Wait for the upload to complete successfully. If you'd like to create a "Product set" (a subset of products in your catalog for use in specific ad sets) you can do that now.

## Setting up App Events and the Facebook Pixel

Facebook requires you to report events about your users interacting with your content, for example: viewing, adding to cart, and purchasing. To add the Facebook Pixel to your website, and the Facebook SDK to your app, follow these instructions:

- [Sending App Events with the Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events){:target="_blank"}
- [Sending Web Events with the Facebook Pixel](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/facebook-pixel/v2.8){:target="_blank"}

Use the "Product events" tab in your Product Catalog view to ensure that Facebook is registering the events against your Product Catalog items correctly.

## Creating a Dynamic Ad Campaign

1. Navigate to [https://www.facebook.com/ads/create](https://www.facebook.com/ads/create){:target="_blank"} while logged in to the account that owns your Facebook app.
1. Choose **Product Catalog Sales**. Select the Product Catalog to which you uploaded your Deep Linked Feed.
1. Select the targeting, bid, budget and placements that you'd like.

{% protip title="Driving installs with dynamic ads" %}
By default, Facebook sends customers without the app to your mobile website. To drive installs, you can send customers without your app the app store by adding a `web_should_fallback` column to your Feed Source and setting each row to `false`. Then, after you've created your campaign, edit the ad within your ad set. Under "Creative," set your "App link destination" to "Deep link, app store backup."
{% endprotip %}

## View your data using the Branch dashboard

The [Source Analytics page](https://dashboard.branch.io/analytics/source) on the Branch dashboard shows the performance of your dynamic ad campaign. 

The [Content Analytics page](https://dashboard.branch.io/analytics/content) on the Branch dashboard shows the performance of individual pieces of content in your dynamic ad campaigns.

You can find your link listed in the table with a quick summary of the _total_ clicks, installs, opens and custom events. 

{% caution %}
Facebook prevents Branch from measuring the number of clicks on their ads for install campaigns, so Branch's **Clicks** numbers for Facebook ads are inaccurate when users are being directed to the App Store to download your app.
{% endcaution %}
