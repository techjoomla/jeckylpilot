## Create a Branch Ad Link

1. Create a Branch Ad link from the [Partner Management page](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management)'s `Create Google Adwords Link` button under the Google Adwords Partner and select `App Install or Engagement`
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/create-link-install-engagement.png' half center alt='Link Creation' %}
1. Under the Define Section, pick a Link Name for later reference
1. Configure the link with the Ad Format set to **App Only**, the Ad Partner set to **Google Adwords**, and the Secondary Ad Format set to **Google Display Install iOS**, while leaving the Campaign field blank
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-display-install-ads/iOS/ad-link-setup.png' 3-quarters center alt='Create Ad Link' %}
1. Under the Configure Options tab, navigate to the Redirects sub section and ensure that the iOS redirect is set to the desired app being promoted by the ad campaign.
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/ad-link-redirect.png' 3-quarters center alt='Create Ad Link' %}
1. Under the Analytics Tags sub section additional tags can be set. It is recommended to not set Channel and Campaign tags as they will be dynamically generated by Google.
{% image src='/img/pages/features/ads-analytics/analytics-tags.png' 3-quarters center alt='Analytics Tags' %}

{% protip title="Dynamic Channel and Campaign Tags" %}

It is recommended to leave the Channel and Campaign Tags empty as Branch will dynamically set those values to their corresponding **Network** and **Campaign Id** values in Adwords. If you fill in these values yourself it may be more difficult to interpret the information between Branch and Adwords.

{% endprotip %}

{% protip title="Optional: Deep Link Data (Advanced)" %}

You can use this configuration section to specify custom link parameters that will be deep linked into the app after install. These could include a coupon code or a page identifier to route the user. Visit the [Deep Link Routing]({{base.url}}/getting-started/deep-link-routing) page to learn more.

{% endprotip %}

{% protip title="Setting Attribution Windows" %}

You can specify the attribution windows for your links either at an overall account or per link level. Use these windows to accurately measure attribution data for your Branch links. Refer to [Changing attribution windows]({{base.url}}/marketing-channels/ad-network-integrations/advanced/#changing-attribution-windows) for instructions.

{% endprotip %}

## Configure an Ad

To set up a Display Network Mobile App Install Campaign on iOS, you will need to first create your campaign and then setup a tracking template on the ad. Adwords campaign creation documentation is available **[here](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6309958?hl=en)**.

#### Create Your Campaign

1. Select `Display Network only` on Adwords
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/adwords-display-network.png' third center alt='Adwords Network' %}
1. For the type of Display campaign select `Install your mobile app`
{% image src='/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-display-install-ads/adwords-display-install.png' 3-quarters center alt='Adwords Setup' %}
1. Continue setting the campaign and ad group parameters

#### Ad Creation

1. Grab your app's iTunes App Store URL and fill it into the **Final URL** field of the ad setup.
1. Expand the `Ad URL options` and place your Branch Ad link from the first section in the **Tracking template** box. Ensure the copied link has the appropriate additional params (~campaign_id, ~ad_set_id, lpurl, etc.) which should be automatically generated on your Branch dashboard.

{% image src="/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-display-install-ads/iOS/full-branch-link.png" 3-quarters center alt='Example Link' %}

{% image src="/img/pages/features/google-dla/google-display-install-ads/iOS/adwords-configuration.png" 3-quarters center alt='Example Adwords Config' %}

{% protip %}

Because the **Final URL** for your app install campaigns must match your app store domain, you cannot put a Branch link in that box. However, capturing installs and deep linking users through content is still possible due to the **Tracking template** configuration.

{% endprotip %}

## FAQ / Debugging

**Q: Why is my advertisement being disapproved on Adwords?**

**A:** For App Install/Engagement Campaigns, sometimes your ad may be disapproved if the Branch link does not re-direct to Google Play or App Store when clicked on a desktop. Please ensure that for the Branch link you're using to track installs, Deepviews are disabled and a desktop redirect is set to either the App / Play store.
