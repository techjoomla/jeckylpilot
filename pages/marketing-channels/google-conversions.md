{% if page.overview %}

If you're using Google Adwords with Branch links, setting up conversion events in Adwords will allow Branch to send app install conversion information to Adwords for verification. We recommend setting this up to help minimize discrepancies between Adwords and Branch conversion values.

Note: Conversions measured here are **app installs**.

Setting up Adwords conversion events with Branch allows Branch to get direct confirmation from Google for which conversion events were driven by an Adwords advertisement and allows Adwords to collect accurate conversion data for your app.

{% prerequisite %}
- To track installs from Google Ads you should [integrate the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/sdk-integration-guide) into your app.
- If you want to deep link from your ads directly to content, you should [configure deep link routing]({{base.url}}/getting-started/deep-link-routing).
- Ads is a premium product priced on Monthly Active Users. Sign up for the Ads product to enable this functionality.
{% endprerequisite %}

{% protip title="Conversion Windows" %}

Adwords has a default 30 day conversion window for app install actions which can't be changed. To minimize discrepancies between Branch and Adwords conversion values, we recommend setting your Branch attribution window to the same value. Navigate to `Link Settings` > `Attribution Windows` and set the **Click to conversion event** to 30 days.
**By default, the window is set to 30 days in the Branch dashboard.**

## FAQ / Debugging

**Q: I'm getting discrepancy between conversion counts in Branch and Google Adwords**

**A:** While we should always expect around a 5% discrepancy due to time zone differences and the like, if you are seeing significant discrepancies, it could be an indication of a broader problem.

**Q: My campaign is reporting a number of conversions much higher than the number of conversions shown in the conversion table in Adwords**

**A:** When viewing a campaign, it shows the sum of all conversion events that apply to it. To view by conversion, navigate to `Segment` > `Conversions` > `Conversion name`, in order to clearly see the breakdown of your campaign's conversions.
