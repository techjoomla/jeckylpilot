Configuring Twitter install ads to use Branch links is very simple. The only trick is that you will be using the website click/conversion ads instead of the standard app install ad. Using Branch links allows you to track ad-driven installs on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app.

{% prerequisite %}

- To track installs from Twitter Ads you should [integrate the Branch SDK]({{base.url}}/getting-started/sdk-integration-guide) into your app.
- If you want to deep link from your ads directly content, you should [configure deep link routing]({{base.url}}/getting-started/deep-link-routing).
