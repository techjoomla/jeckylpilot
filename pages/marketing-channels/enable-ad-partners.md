## Create an ad link

Once you've enabled an ad partner, it's time to create a tracking link.

First, set your ad format. If you're using an ad network integration for an **App Install** or 


{% protip title="Optional: Deep Link Data (Advanced)" %}

You can use this configuration section to specify custom link parameters that will be deep linked into the app after install. These could include a coupon code or a page identifier to route the user. Visit the [Deep Link Routing]({{base.url}}/getting-started/deep-link-routing) page to learn more.

{% endprotip %}

{% protip title="Additional Analytic parameters" %}

It's easier to slice your data in our analytics platform if you properly assign analytics parameters to your link. Look for the "Analytics" subtab of "Configure Options to ad analytics parameters"

{% endprotip %}

## Configure an ad

When you create your ad, paste your ad link into 

{% protip %}
If you are running **Search Install Ads** on **Android** only, you'll need to modify your Play Store URL and be on v2.6.0 of the Branch Android SDK. Simply append &referrer=google_search_install_referrer%3D\<link-id\> to the end of your Play Store URL, but be sure to replace \<link-id\> with the ID of the link created above. The Play Store URL should not have brackets, and would look like this: https://play.google.com/io.branch.branchster?referrer=google_search_install_referrer%3D123456789. In order to get the link id follow the steps mentioned below:
	
**1)** Grab the Branch link off of the dashboard and append `?debug=true` to the end of it. For example:{% highlight sh %}https://branchster.app.link/znlg7dlCJD{% endhighlight %} would become {% highlight sh %}https://branchster.app.link/znlg7dlCJD?debug=true{% endhighlight %}

**2)** Paste the link with `?debug=true` into your desktop browser’s address bar.

**3)** You can read the link ID from the redirected URL in the browser address bar, as well as the “~id” parameter in the “Data” section on the page. In example below, `400316647170355019` is the link ID.{% highlight sh %}https://dashboard.branch.io/link-debug/400316647170355019{% endhighlight %}
{% endprotip %}

{% protip %}
Because the **Final URL** for your app install campaigns must match your domain, you cannot put a Branch link in that box. However, capturing installs and deep linking users through content is still possible due to the **Tracking template** configuration.
{% endprotip %}

## View your data using the Branch dashboard

The [Marketing page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/marketing) on the Branch dashboard shows the performance of each individual link. You can find your link listed in the table with a quick summary of the _total_ clicks and installs.

To view more detailed stats, click the _small button that looks like a bar chart_ on the far right. Note that these stats are **limited to the date range** at the top. You can expand the range if you'd like.

## FAQ / Debugging

Sometimes, your ad may be disapproved if the Branch link does not re-direct to Google Play or App Store when clicked on a desktop. Please ensure that for the Branch link you're using to track installs, Deepviews are disabled and a desktop redirect is set to either the App / Play store.
