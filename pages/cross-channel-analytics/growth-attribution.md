{% ingredient quickstart-prerequisite %}{% endingredient %}

You can measure your app growth in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io){:target="_blank"} through automatic event tracking and user identity tracking.

## Automatic event tracking

Branch _automatically_ creates events whenever a user accesses your site or your app. We measure installs, re-opens and web page visits with separate events. Here is a list of the auto-created ones:

| Event | Description
| --- | ---
| `install` | Triggered the first time a user launches your app
| `open` | Triggered whenever the app becomes active (includes reinstalls)
| `referred session` | Triggered *in addition* to install, open or web session start if a user comes from a Branch link
| `web session start` | Triggered when the user views a webpage using the Branch Web SDK.

{% protip title="Receiving Postbacks" %}
You can be notified via a postback to your server every time that an event occurs. Visit the [Webhooks](/getting-started/webhooks/) page for more information on configuring postbacks.
{% endprotip %}

You can also define as many custom events (signups, purchases, shares, etc.) as you wish - see the [User Value Attribution]({{base.url}}/getting-started/user-value-attribution) guide for more on tracking custom events. You can see these events as they occur on the [Live View > Events](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/liveview/events/view){:target="_blank"} page.

## Setting identities

Identifying your users will help you associate all activities and links created to a particular person. This can show you which of your users are the most influential.

{% if page.ios %}

### Log in

Add a `setIdentity` call wherever you create or login a user. This should be done after you have successfully initialized a Branch session. Only call `setIdentity` when the user first logs in. We will cache the identity for future sessions.

{% tabs %}
{% tab objective-c %}
{% highlight objc %}
// your app's userId, 127 chars or less
[[Branch getInstance] setIdentity:@"your user id"];
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}
{% highlight swift %}
// your app's userId, 127 chars or less
Branch.getInstance().setIdentity("your user id")
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Log out

Add a `logout` call anywhere you allow the user to logout. `Logout` should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call `logout` can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.

{% tabs %}
{% tab objective-c %}
{% highlight objc %}
[[Branch getInstance] logout];
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab swift %}
{% highlight swift %}
Branch.getInstance().logout()
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% endif %}
<!--- iOS identify and logout -->

{% if page.android %}

### Log in

Add a `setIdentity` call wherever you create or login a user. This should be done after you have successfully initialized a Branch session. Only call `setIdentity` when the user first logs in. We will cache the identity for future sessions.

{% highlight java %}
// your app's userId, 127 chars or less
Branch.getInstance().setIdentity("your user id");
{% endhighlight %}

### Log out

Add a `logout` call anywhere you allow the user to logout. `Logout` should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call `logout` can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.

{% highlight java %}
Branch.getInstance().logout();

<!--- Android identify and logout -->

{% if page.cordova %}

### Log in

Add a `setIdentity` call wherever you create or login a user. This should be done after you have successfully initialized a Branch session. Only call `setIdentity` when the user first logs in. We will cache the identity for future sessions.

{% highlight js %}
Branch.setIdentity("your user id").then(function (res) {
  console.log(res);
}).catch(function (err) {
  console.error(err);
});
{% endhighlight %}

### Log out

Add a `logout` call anywhere you allow the user to logout. `Logout` should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call `logout` can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.

{% highlight js %}
Branch.logout();
{% endhighlight %}
{% endif %}

{% if page.xamarin %}

### Log in

Add a `SetIdentity` call wherever you create or login a user. This should be done after you have successfully initialized a Branch session. Only call `SetIdentityAsync` when the user first logs in. We will cache the identity for future sessions.

{% highlight c# %}
Branch branch = Branch.GetInstance ();
branch.SetIdentity("your user id", this);
{% endhighlight %}

### Log out

Add a `LogoutAsync` call anywhere you allow the user to logout. `LogoutAsync` should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call `LogoutAsync` can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.

{% highlight c# %}
Branch.GetInstance(getApplicationContext()).LogoutAsync(this);
{% endhighlight %}

{% endif %}

{% if page.unity %}

### Log in

Add a `setIdentity` call wherever you create or login a user. This should be done after you have successfully initialized a Branch session. Only call `setIdentity` when the user first logs in. We will cache the identity for future sessions.

{% highlight c# %}
Branch.setIdentity("your user id");
{% endhighlight %}

### Log out

Add a `logout` call anywhere you allow the user to logout. `Logout` should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call `logout` can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.

{% highlight c# %}
Branch.logout();
{% endhighlight %}
{% endif %}

{% if page.adobe %}

### Log in

{% highlight java %}
branch.setIdentity("your user id");
{% endhighlight %}

### Log out

Add a `logout` call anywhere you allow the user to logout. `Logout` should only be called when the user logs out. Calling it at other times could lead to hard-to-discover errors. Failing to call `logout` can likewise lead to bugs if multiple users log in on the same device.

{% highlight java %}

{% if page.titanium %}

### Log in

{% highlight js %}
branch.setIdentity("your user id");

## Log in

Add a `setIdentity` call wherever you create or login a user. This should be done after you have successfully initialized a Branch session. Only call `setIdentity` when the user first logs in. We will cache the identity for future sessions.

{% highlight js %}
branch.setIdentity("your user id");
{% endhighlight %}

## Log out

{% highlight js %}
branch.logout();
{% endhighlight %}
{% endif %}

{% protip title="Retroactive event attribution" %}
The **first** time an identity is set for each unique user ID, it will retroactively associate any previously recorded events from the current device with that user ID. This only occurs once.
{% endprotip %}

## Measuring influencers

The [Influencers page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/referrals/influencers){:target="_blank"} on the dashboard will show you who is driving the most new signups.

{% image src='/img/pages/getting-started/growth-attribution/influencers.png' full center alt='analytics filtering options' %}

{% protip %}
You must [identify your users](/cross-channel-analytics/growth-attribution/guide/ios/#setting-identities) in order for the `User ID` column to be populated. The `Branch ID` refers to the internal Branch ID associated with that user. It is set automatically in the SDK.
{% endprotip %}
